# Image Segmentation
Description: Image Segmentation using the standard algorithm for image segmentation (KMeans Algorithm).
However, I am also trying something new by using the Karger's Min-Cut algorithm to segment the image. 

Purpose: I made this program to learn more about Image Segmentation and is also intended for other beginners to learn Image Segmentation through a working example. I am posting important information about this project underneath to help others gain atleast a minimal understanding of this code along with proper documentation in the code.

**Note:** Not using any libraries/frameworks outside of the initial Java library.

**Another note:** The code is documented very well and includes the time complexity of most functions

Thanks to [Santiago Coffey](https://github.com/scoffey) for his contribution of his Image Segmentation program, which I largely based my code on. I recommend you check out his project as well to get a better understanding of Image Segmentation and the implementation of other algorithms to achive a similar product. I also made a few improvements from his code regarding the speed of the K-Means algorithm and the flow of data in general.
